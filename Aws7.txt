ssh

Aws7  31 minutes ago 
the script wont work unless the user connected through the ssh

Aws7  30 minutes ago 
if not the program will exit

Aws7  30 minutes ago 
because the VirtualBox is on the cluster node 

Aws7  30 minutes ago 
and the user will use the pc to connect to the cluster node

Aws7  30 minutes ago 
$username@$server

Aws7  29 minutes ago 
ssh $username@$server

zkutch  Yesterday 
Hi. Are you here?

zkutch  Yesterday 
?

zkutch  Yesterday 
script is ready working locally. The most easy way to execute it through ssh is to copy it to remote comp and execute
ssh remote_user@remote_comp ./path_to_script
waiting your answer..

zkutch  Yesterday 
No answer from you - when finished your time? Anyway I attach script and waiting again.
 vb_ctl.sh Download 

zkutch  Yesterday 
Had added new option - info - you still are not on connection: I think this automatically changes deadline.
 vb_ctl.sh Download

I cannot be here all night, at me now 2.40am deep night. I'll wait you tomorrow to close project. Thanks.

Aws7  20 hours ago 
Hi, if u mean that I have to copy the script bash to the node cluster, the answer is no, because I want to use it my pc to get ssh access to the cluster node to run the virtualbox and do all the options that I gave you.

Aws7  17 hours ago 
i saw the bash script , but there is no ssh connection feature ! , I don't want to store this script in the cluster node , I want it in my pc and do all the commends that you wrote after login through ssh , so I want ssh login feature on it , and this is the point

zkutch  5 hours ago 
I understand your position and if somewhere in future you will want and I'll have time we can discuss why your way is worse and solution suggested by me is best.

But now I followed your order and prepared script also for working with ssh. 
Before I provide it let me set question:
You yourself put very hard deadline and then in last day had disappeared. I waited you almost 18 hours with ready solution (it is best, see 1-st paragraph) and without your answer.
you ruined not only your deadline, but also lost my time when I was ready to finish project accordingly your wishes and waited you. I am forced to work also on monday and this takes my monday time, which I not planned so. Question:
What do you think about?


Aws7  49 minutes ago 
ok i release the money and i gave you a good feedback , but i was thinking if u can put some lines to connect to ssh and after login ssh do the script without put the script into the cluster

zkutch  1 minute ago 
Thanks for understanding. I suggest to open new project and there I'll make ssh - ok?

why new project?

Aws7  8 minutes ago 
in the project description i wrote " 1- Connecting to the cluster node by type the username and the host . ex: $username@$clusterhost"
Ã—

Aws7  8 minutes ago 
and you didn't do that sir


You are right and I agree with you. From one hand. Excuse me for repeating, but if we did not lost time at sunday, then everything will finished for now.

Let's look from another hand: As time was lost on sunday, then I need to arrange my time tomorrow for this task. My time is my money,
is it so?

Additionally new project, if successfully finished, will increase both reputation yours and mine. Job remained for implement ssh in all options is not less, then already done, but if/when we come to agreement I'll finish it in one day - tomorrow. 

So benefits from new project for both are clear.

What do you think about?
